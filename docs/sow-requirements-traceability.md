## 4. Detailed Requirements Implementation

### 4.1 How Franchise Health Score (FHS™) Works End-to-End

```
STEP 1: DATA COLLECTION (Continuous)
──────────────────────────────────────
Clover POS → Transactions (every 15 min)
                ↓
Payment API → Settlements + Chargebacks (daily)
                ↓
CRM/Loyalty → Customer data (hourly)
                ↓
Campaign Events → Opens, clicks, conversions (real-time webhooks)


STEP 2: METRIC CALCULATION (Materialized Views — refreshed every 15 min)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
mv_store_daily_performance:
  → gross_revenue, refund_total, transaction_count, unique_customers, avg_ticket_size

Customer retention query:
  → Returning customers (visited 2+ times in 30 days) / Total unique customers


STEP 3: FACTOR SCORING (BullMQ scheduled job — hourly)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For each store:

  ┌────────────────────────┬────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Factor                 │ Weight │ Calculation                          │
  ├────────────────────────┼────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Revenue Growth         │  20%   │ (rev_30d - rev_prev_30d) / prev     │

### 4.2 How Customer Intelligence Works End-to-End

```
STEP 1: CUSTOMER ACQUISITION
─────────────────────────────
Source 1 (Clover POS):
  Transaction → Clover customer_id → email + phone
  Normalized → customers table (clover_id, email, phone, name)

Source 2 (CRM/Loyalty):
  Contact → crm_id → email + phone + loyalty data
  Merged with existing customer by email match
  → customers.loyalty_id, loyalty_points, loyalty_tier

Source 3 (Payment Token):
  Settlement → card_brand + last_four (tokenized)
  Associated with customer via transaction linkage
  → NO raw card data stored (PCI compliance)


STEP 2: PROFILE ENRICHMENT (Continuous)
────────────────────────────────────────
On each transaction:
  customers.visit_count += 1
  customers.total_spend += transaction.net_amount
  customers.last_visit_at = transaction.transacted_at

On loyalty update:
  customers.loyalty_points = new_value
  customers.loyalty_tier = new_tier


STEP 3: AI SCORING (BullMQ daily job)
──────────────────────────────────────
For each customer:

  RFM Score:
    Recency  = days_since_last_visit → 0-100 (lower days = higher score)
    Frequency = visits_per_month → 0-100 (more visits = higher score)
    Monetary  = avg_spend_per_visit → 0-100 (higher spend = higher score)

  Churn Probability (0–1):
    Based on recency decay function + frequency trend

  Lifecycle Segment:
    ┌─────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Segment     │ Criteria                             │
    ├─────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ New         │ First visit < 30 days ago            │
    │ Active      │ Visited in last 30 days              │
    │ Loyal       │ 5+ visits in last 60 days            │
    │ VIP         │ Top 10% by spend + 10+ visits        │
    │ At Risk     │ No visit in 21-45 days               │
    │ Dormant     │ No visit in 45-90 days               │
    │ Recovered   │ Returned after being Dormant         │
    └─────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘

  Stored in:
    ai_scores (entity_type='customer', entity_id=customer_id,
               score_type='customer_churn', score_value=0.72,
               factors={segment:'At Risk', rfm:{R:35,F:20,M:70}})


STEP 4: AUTOMATION TRIGGERS (BullMQ daily check)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
For each active automation rule:

  IF trigger = 'customer_inactive' AND conditions.daysSinceLastVisit = 21:
    → Find customers where last_visit_at < NOW() - 21 days
    → Exclude already-triggered (cooldown check)
    → For each matching customer:
      → Render email/SMS template with customer data
      → Send via SendGrid/Twilio
      → Log in campaign_events

  IF trigger = 'churn_risk_high' AND conditions.churnScore > 0.7:
    → Find customers from ai_scores where score_value > 0.7
    → Execute retention campaign action


STEP 5: OUTCOME TRACKING
─────────────────────────
Campaign sent → customer visits again (transaction with matching customer_id)
  → Segment changes from "At Risk" → "Recovered"
  → Customer Health Score improves
  → Store Health Score improves (retention factor)
  → Network Health Score improves

This creates the virtuous cycle described in the PRD:
  Transactions → Customer Identity → AI Marketing → Repeat Visits
  → Revenue Growth → Better Forecasting → Stronger FHS™
```

### 4.3 How AI Copilot Works End-to-End

```
USER ASKS: "Why are sales down at Store #42?"

STEP 1: INTENT CLASSIFICATION
──────────────────────────────
Input: "Why are sales down at Store #42?"
Classification: {
  intent: 'revenue_analysis',
  entities: { store: '#42' },
  timeRange: 'recent' (default: last 30 days),
  scope: 'single_store'
}

STEP 2: RBAC CHECK
──────────────────
User role: Franchisor → Can access Store #42? YES (owns franchise)
If Franchisee → Can access Store #42? Only if it's their store

STEP 3: CONTEXT ASSEMBLY
─────────────────────────
Queries executed (all from PostgreSQL):

  a) Revenue time series (last 60 days — 30 current + 30 comparison):
     SELECT date, net_revenue, transaction_count, avg_ticket_size
     FROM mv_store_daily_performance
     WHERE store_id = '42' AND date >= NOW() - 60 days

  b) Period comparison:
     Current 30d revenue: $28,400
     Previous 30d revenue: $34,200
     Change: -17%

  c) Health score + factors:
     SELECT score_value, factors, narrative
     FROM ai_scores
     WHERE entity_id = '42' AND score_type = 'health'

  d) Customer metrics:
     New customers this period: 45
     At-risk customers: 28
     Churn rate: 18%

  e) Refund data:
     Refund rate: 4.2% (vs 2.1% network average)

  f) Peer comparison:
     Store #42 rank: 118 / 127 stores
     Network average revenue: $36,800

STEP 4: PROMPT CONSTRUCTION
────────────────────────────
System: "You are a senior franchise business analyst..."

Context: [all assembled data above in structured format]

User: "Why are sales down at Store #42?"

Format: "Respond with: 1) Summary, 2) Root Causes,
         3) Supporting Data, 4) Recommended Actions"

STEP 5: STREAMING RESPONSE (SSE)
─────────────────────────────────
Claude API called with streaming enabled.
Each token streamed to frontend via Server-Sent Events.

Response (rendered in chat panel):

  "Store #42 is experiencing a 17% revenue decline over the
   past 30 days ($28,400 vs. $34,200 prior period).

   Root Causes:
   1. Customer Traffic Down: 23% fewer unique customers (892 vs 1,158).
      28 customers are classified as "At Risk" — they haven't
      visited in 21+ days.

   2. Elevated Refund Rate: 4.2% refund rate is double the
      network average (2.1%). This is pulling net revenue down
      by approximately $1,200.

   3. Average Ticket Stable: $31.83 (vs $29.52 network avg) —
      per-customer spend is actually healthy.

   Recommended Actions:
   1. Launch a reactivation campaign targeting the 28 at-risk
      customers with a 15% discount offer.
   2. Investigate the refund spike — review top refund reasons
      for the past 30 days.
   3. Consider a weekday lunch promotion to drive traffic during
      low-volume periods.

   [Create Campaign] [View Refund Details] [Compare with Top Store]"

STEP 6: SESSION PERSISTENCE
────────────────────────────
Conversation saved in ai_copilot_sessions:
  messages: [
    {role: 'user', content: 'Why are sales down at Store #42?'},
    {role: 'assistant', content: '...full response...'}
  ]

User can follow up: "Create a campaign for those at-risk customers"
  → Intent: 'campaign'
  → Context: Carries forward Store #42 + at-risk customer list
  → AI generates campaign content
